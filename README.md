# CARDIOTUNE
Cardiotune cycling is a platform that generates, collects and processes real-time and historical data on physiological indicators, cycling bio-mechanical parameters and environmental factors, during urban cycling.

Using smart-grips on Bicycle Sharing Systems (BSS) bicycles, it uploads data via IoT from thousands of daily trips (combinations of cyclists, bicycles and followed routes) to train ML/DL models that infer key indicators about public health and training levels, cycling performance, and environmental conditions including hyperlocal weather, pollution levels and IoT network coverage.
